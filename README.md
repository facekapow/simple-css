# simple-css
An extremely simple CSS3 style template for a modern look.

Feel free to override any of the styles in your own stylesheet.

Comes with a light and dark theme (light theme is default, for a dark theme add 'simple--dark' to your body classes).<br>
Makes heavy use of box-shadows and transitions.<br>
You don't need to add any special classes to elements (with the exception of 'simple--dark' to the body for a dark theme).<br>

(I recommend using [Raleway](https://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Raleway) as your font).
